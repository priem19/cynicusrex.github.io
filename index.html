    <p class="intro">Hi. My name is Angelino Desmet and welcome to Cynicus Rex. Here you'll find my preoccupations frequently influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy)">Cynicism</a>, the philosophy that pursues an <strong>equilibrium with nature</strong>.</p>

    <p class="intro">From the moment I read <a href=""><em>Diogenes the Cynic: Sayings and Anecdotes, with Other Popular Moralists</em></a> by <em>Robin Hard</em>, I made new friends. Unfortunately they lived over two thousand years ago. But that's where you and I come in: it's time to join forces and reinvigorate Cynicism because humanity has lost its way in discerning what's worth living for.</p>

    <p class="intro">Many will consider me or Cynicism too extreme. Granted, for I am of the all-or-nothing persuasion. But just as metastasizing cancers are treated with chemotherapy, malignant ideas need to be treated with supreme philosophies. Usually moderation is key, but sometimes that just doesn't cut it.</p>

    <p id="outro-lyrics">«I'm the king of my own land <br>
      Facing tempests of dust, I'll fight until the end <br>
      Creatures of my dreams raise up and dance with me! <br>
      Now and forever, I'm your king!»</p>
