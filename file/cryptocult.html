    <h1>Bitcoin is mind cancer.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">Disregarding all of bitcoin's shortcomings, a financial instrument that brings out the worst in people—greed—won't change the world for the better.</p>

    <hr class="hr-long">

    <h2>Preamble.</h2>
    <p>I'm not necessarily against digital currencies. I've bought them, I've earned them, and I've used them. I came for the profit and I stayed for the tech. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't found it fascinating, for a while. Obviously there's technological and academic merit behind cryptography, but far less so for cryptocurrencies despite what the evangelists try to sell you <span class="source">()</span>. Realizing the extent of its shady, ignorant, and spam-happy proponents who speak in half-truths, false promises, and lies*, I chose to opt out. Since then it has only gotten worse. Their arsenal now includes dimwitted insults such as “have fun staying poor” and including laser eyes on their profile pictures. Cool. This whole ordeal has more in common with a pyramid scheme rather than a reasonable investment. Let alone something revolutionary. Truly revolutionary things don't need convincing to see their awesomeness <span class="source">()</span>. I bet the Wright Brother didn't go “have fun staying grounded” on the <span title="The joke will be lost on at least one cryptocurrency wiseguy.">Internet</span>. Anyway, with some imagination one could compare this behavior with Leukemia. Bitcoin as a mind cancer, if you will.</p>

    <p class="quote">Leukemia is a blood cancer caused by a rise in the number of white blood cells in your body. Those white blood cells crowd out the red blood cells and platelets that your body needs to be healthy. The extra white blood cells don’t work right <span class="source">()</span>.</p>

    <p>Just as those white blood cells, the bitcoin evangelists don't work quite right as well—hiding behind the charade of being an immune response against evil bankers. Yes. Bitcoin was invented to subvert fraudulent contemporary finance <span class="source">()</span>. Which is a respectable purpose. But with a modicum of scrutiny one notices that bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) has veered far from its original promise: “A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” <span class="source">()</span>, aka money by the people, for the people, against the banks. Instead it desperately needs the banks for normal people to buy it since it has become practically impossible for them to get their hands on it through mining with their computers. Subsequently it spawned dozens of new fraudulent banks (exchanges) which have and may still be manipulating the price by buying with exchange-printed fake money <span class="source">()</span>. To top it off, they arbitrarily cheer whenever anyone well known (shady or not, bank or not) adopts it. For goodness sake, it has become a cesspool with the same kind of people that got us into this mess in the first place. Bitcoin isn't a cure, it's the same disease: money. Money in the hands of humans. </p>

    <p>Have I been salty? Definitely; I could've bought a house had I been in a coma until now. So there's no point in denying that. Even worse, I used to experience cognitive dissonance because despite not supporting it, I am aware that it could still grow larger. After all, human greed and stupidity affects the best of us. Case in point: Isaac Newton. He was a mathematical prodigy, but he was also a religious alchemist who invested in the South Sea Bubble <span class="source">()</span>. Moreover, the ultimate irony, <em>Tesla</em> drank the Kool-Aid as well; the company I initially invested in <span class="source">()</span>. Therefore I have no confidence in predicting the course of this mania. Moreover, even if my “investments”† had worked out, I would've merely been lucky by acting on false assumptions. Bitcoin isn't the be-all and end-all, and neither is Elon Musk, but that's another story <span class="source">()</span>.</p>

    <p class="footnote">* Some do so malevolently, others ignorantly but benevolently.</p>
    <p class="footnote">† Using the word investments in this context is even cringy to write.</p>

    <h2>But it's deflationary?</h2>
    <p>It doesn't matter if the currency has a limited supply or not because it doesn't stop fractional reserve banking. Which is what instigated the creation of bitcoin in the first place. Hence mentioning the headline “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” in the genesis block.</p>

    <p>“I don't care if we have new banks, as long as I am rich.”</p>

    <h2>Greed.</h2>
    <p>This is the elephant in the room. Bitcoin solves exactly nothing. It's still money. Whether we use cash, digital money, or Elon Musk's fart particles as currency, as long as humans can't evolve beyond their greedy nature, nothing will change.</p>

    <h2>The solutions?</h2>
    <p>Just put financial hucksters in jail.</p>

    <p>stop revering rich people</p>
