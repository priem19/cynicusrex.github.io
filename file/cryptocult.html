    <h1>Money corrupts; bitcoin corrupts absolutely.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">Disregarding all of bitcoin's shortcomings, a financial instrument that brings out the worst in people‚Äîgreed‚Äîwon't change the world for the better.</p>

    <hr class="hr-long">

    <h2>Preamble.</h2>
    <p>I'm not necessarily against digital currencies. I've bought them, I've earned them, and I've used them. I came for the profit and I stayed for the tech. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't found it fascinating, for a while. Obviously there's technological and academic merit behind cryptography, but far less so for cryptocurrencies despite what the evangelists try to sell you <span class="source">()</span>. Realizing the extent of its shady, ignorant <span class="source">()</span>, and spam-happy proponents who speak in half-truths, false promises, and lies*, I chose to opt out <span class="source">()</span>. Since then it has only gotten worse. Their arsenal now includes dimwitted insults such as ‚Äúhave fun staying poor‚Äù while shooting lasers out their eyes <span class="source">()</span>. Cool. This whole ordeal has more in common with a pyramid scheme rather than a reasonable investment. Let alone something revolutionary. Truly revolutionary things don't need incessant spam to convey their awesomeness <span class="source">()</span>. I bet the Wright Brothers never uttered ‚Äúhave fun staying grounded‚Äù on the <span title="The joke will most certainly be lost on at least one cryptocurrency wiseguy.">Internet</span>. </p>

    <!-- <p>Anyway, with some imagination one could compare this behavior with Leukemia. Bitcoin as a mind cancer, if you will.</p>

    <p class="quote">Leukemia is a blood cancer caused by a rise in the number of white blood cells in your body. Those white blood cells crowd out the red blood cells and platelets that your body needs to be healthy. The extra white blood cells don‚Äôt work right <span class="source">()</span>.</p>

    <p>Similarly, the bitcoin evangelists don't work quite right as well‚Äîhiding behind the charade of being an immune response against the evil bankers </p> -->


    <p>Sure, bitcoin was invented to subvert fraudulent contemporary finance  or untouchable bankers <span class="source">()</span>. Which is a respectable cause I stand behind. But with a modicum of scrutiny one notices that bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) has veered far from its original premise: ‚ÄúA Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System‚Äù <span class="source">()</span>, i.e., money by the people, for the people, against the banks. For one, its predominant use-case isn't cash but financial speculation, gambling. Secondly, it desperately needs the banks for normal people to buy it since obtaining it through mining on regular PCs has become impractical. So much for democratic and decentralized. Yes, you can still host your own full node (a keeper of the complete ledger) but that alone wasn't the original intent. It's like buying food you can't eat, but being happy you can smell it. Subsequently it spawned dozens of new fraudulent banks (exchanges) which have and may still be manipulating the price by buying with exchange-printed fake money <span class="source">()</span>. To top it off, they arbitrarily cheer whenever anyone well-known adopts it, regardless of their background. If John McAfee eating his dick is fine <span class="source">()</span>, then ‚ÄúCharles Manson is good for bitcoin‚Äù wouldn't surprise me at all. Laissez-faire, am I right? Right, hence: ‚ÄúJohn McAfee Indicted On Fraud, Money Laundering Charges In Pump-And-Dump Crypto Scheme‚Äù <span class="source">()</span>. That's another one down. For goodness sake, it has become a cesspool of greed that got us into this mess in the first place <span class="source">()</span>. Bitcoin isn't a cure, it's the same disease: money. Money in the hands of fallible humans.</p>

    <p>Have I been salty? Definitely; I could've bought a house had I been in a coma until now. There's no point in denying that. Even worse, I used to experience cognitive dissonance because despite not supporting it, I am aware that it could still grow larger. After all, human greed and stupidity affects the best of us. Case in point: Isaac Newton. He was a mathematical prodigy, but he was also a religious alchemist who invested in the South Sea Bubble <span class="source">()</span>. Moreover, the ultimate irony, <em>Tesla</em> drank the Kool-Aid as well; the company I initially invested in. Therefore I have no confidence in predicting the course of this mania. Moreover, even if my ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù‚Ä† had worked out, I would've merely been lucky by acting on false assumptions and naive convictions. Bitcoin isn't the be-all and end-all, and neither is Elon Musk, but that's another story <span class="source">()</span>.</p>

    <p class="footnote">‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì</p>
    <p class="footnote">* Some do so malevolently, others ignorantly but benevolently.</p>
    <p class="footnote">‚Ä† Using the word investments in this context is even cringy to write.</p>

    <h2>‚ÄúThe cake is a lie.‚Äù Why bitcoin won't solve anything.</h2>
    <h3>Greed.</h3>
    <p>Greed is the elephant in the room. Bitcoin is still money in the hands of fallible people. Whether it's cash, digital, or a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) of Elon Musk's fart particles, no matter the currency, as long as humans can't evolve beyond their greedy nature, nothing will change. All bitcoin has done is make yet another group of rich people, who, as usual, will do anything to preserve and increase their wealth. As an example I refer to source () again, where Max Keiser rips a ten dollar bill and says he will just buy politicians. Or the next quote by some bitcoin millionaire on an online forum I used to frequent:</p>

    <p class="quote">‚ÄúI've always used Bitcoin as an insurance against corrupted governments by private companies. The tip is to move to a country where the government is corrupted by crypto holders! üòÇ ... and you don't have to move to small island to do that. There is plenty of rich country doing so.‚Äù ‚ÄîName I won't mention, living in France.</p>

    <p>That doesn't spell confidence or competence as the next ‚Äúelite‚Äù, does it. Neither did I. As soon as I felt being rich was within my grasp I began to think selfishly: ‚ÄúNo way I'm giving any of this to governments.‚Äù Which is fine in truly oppressed countries. But if one inhabits a developed country, chances are that being able to afford cryptocurrencies in the first place is due to the fortunate opportunities you or your parents enjoyed due to, among other things, good governance. Whether your ego likes it or not, most success is due to luck <span class="source">()</span>. In the end, governments aren't inherently bad, but the people in it <em>can</em> be. And if they can be corrupted by bitcoin, then we're in the same predicament.</p>

    <!-- <p>.</p> -->

    <p class="quote">‚ÄúStrong currencies are not the solution to poor governance. Good governance and democracy makes a country and its currency strong. Not vice versa.‚Äù ‚Äîhalukakin, HackerNews <span class="source">()</span></p>

    <p>That being said, governments are not without faults, but likewise not the evil boogeymen as many people make them out to be, and neither are bitcoin enthusiasts. I still think most people mean well, but our ideas cannot account for, nor comprehend the complexity of it all. Should the US decrease their disproportionally large defence budget? Most definitely. Will bitcoin stop that? Probably not. Blame is easy, change is hard <span class="source">()</span>; and gambling on cryptocurrencies is not hard. I don't want taxations going to national defence* and bank bailouts either, but that's not all it goes to. That's why I consider being against taxation somewhat hypocritical. Bitcoiners, usually libertarians, despise the notion of Universal Basic Income (UBI), yet they have no problem in receiving money by means of a pyramid scheme, i.e., other people buying bitcoin after them. And what does this transfer of wealth add to society? Or the less fortunate? Or the unbanked? Nothing. It just increases the wealth gap some more. Meanwhile the majority of people in most need of UBI definitely <em>do</em> add value to society. Because after all, they aren't hedge <span title="Accidental typo, deliberately unchanged.">fudge</span> managers. Relieving humans from having to worry about or deal with money would be an <em>actual</em> Copernican revolution. How that would work is beyond me, but that's exactly why it would be revolutionary. Copernicus let the world revolve around the sun, bitcoin let everything revolve around ourselves. Think bigger. </p>

    <p>By means of the governance argument I'll segway into bitcoins energy consumption. I agree that if all energy production was carbon neutral, it wouldn't be so much of a problem, in a vacuum. However, it isn't carbon neutral, nor in a vacuum. Bitcoin evangelists claim that the benefits of ‚Äúsound money‚Äù‚Ä† far outweigh the negatives of its energy consumption. Which it would be if it really were the solution to everything. But as previously stated, ‚Äúgood‚Äù money doesn't procure good governance.</p>

    <p class="quote">‚ÄúIf you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're gonna get selfish, ignorant leaders.‚Äù ‚ÄîGeorge Carlin</p>

    <p>Additionally, we shouldn't be okay with something so noisy and inefficient because we can‚Äîgreed‚Äîor because other industries do so too‚Äîwhataboutism. Those are unimpressive arguments. Even Bjarne Stroustrup dislikes his extremely efficient C++ being used for the extremely inefficient bitcoin <span class="source">()</span>. There is an argument to be made that mining is A much better usecase for this excess energy would be </p>

    <p class="footnote">‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì</p>
    <p class="footnote">* National defence is also not necessarily bad, at least for now, until humanity is truly Cosmopolitan.</p>
    <p class="footnote">‚Ä† ‚ÄúSound money: money not liable to sudden appreciation or depreciation in value : stable money‚Äù, Merriam-Webster.</p>

    <h3>Fractional reserve banking.</h3>
    <p>Even if there's a cap of 21 million bitcoin, and if we assume the code won't be altered, it does not stop fractional reserve banking. Just as governments went off the gold standard, they can get off the bitcoin standard. And just as banks lend out money they don't have, they can lend out bitcoin they don't have. Which already happens, a lot. Since most people can't be bothered to get their money of an exchange into their own wallet, they don't actually own their digital coins. As a result, exchanges can do whatever financial shenanigans because they know their customers won't do so.</p>
    <p>This debate of sound money vs. fiat money isn't new. In fact, one of the most reverberating speeches in US history was centered on exactly the same problem: William Jennings Bryan's Cross of Gold speech <span class="source">()</span>.</p>
    <p>Since bitcoin hasn't delivered on its initial promises, it caused a periodical change of narrative. Currently the stock-to-flow theory or the deflationary aspect is its final vestige. ‚ÄúInflation is theft‚Äù is something that instinctively feels right. Let's say you had 10000 in savings, while earning 1000 a month. If due to inflation your savings buy only 9000 worth of stuff, you basically worked a month for free.  That rubs me in the wrong way as well. However, things aren't so cut-and-dry, no matter how much you want it to be (or I wanted it to be). While saving is a virtue, hoarding isn't. And there's a thin line between the two; prudence can turn into greed remarkably quick. Moreover, on a deflationary currency there would hardly be any significant technological progress, lifting millions from poverty. It doesn't matter if the currency has a limited supply or not because it doesn't stop fractional reserve banking. Which is what instigated the creation of bitcoin in the first place. Hence mentioning the headline ‚ÄúThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks‚Äù in the genesis block.</p>

    <p>‚ÄúI don't care if we have new banks, as long as I am rich.‚Äù</p>

<!--     <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania</p>
    <p>Tulip mania reached its peak during the winter of 1636‚Äì37, when some bulb contracts were reportedly changing hands ten times in a day. No deliveries were ever made to fulfill any of these contracts, because in February 1637, tulip bulb contract prices collapsed abruptly and the trade of tulips ground to a halt.[44] The collapse began in Haarlem, when, for the first time, buyers apparently refused to show up at a routine bulb auction. This may have been because Haarlem was then suffering from an outbreak of bubonic plague. The existence of the plague may have helped to create a culture of fatalistic risk-taking that allowed the speculation to skyrocket in the first place;[45] this outbreak might also have helped to burst the bubble.</p> -->


    <h2>Fiat vs. Bitcoin</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>No idea where to put this yet</h2>
    <p>It's making people rich that don't deserve it. I think if it were cancer researchers, or astronauts who were raking in millions of dollars, there would be far less outcry because these people actually inspire. They have a tangible impact on society. Conversely, these lucky gamblers inspire nothing. Being obsessed with money is an inspirational black hole. It doesn't nurture curiosity or wonder in real society advancing things at all. It's just money.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>All these shortcoming slowly trickle through after being barraged with its supposed world-changing benefits. You realize the significance of these shortcomings, but once you have vested interests you try to reason your way out of it by any means necessary. Just as religion, bitcoin requires suppression of rational thought and adherence to dogma. This is why bitcoin will corrupt, absolutely.</p>
