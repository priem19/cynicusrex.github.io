    <h1>Bitcoin is mind cancer.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">Disregarding all of bitcoin's shortcomings, a financial instrument that brings out the worst in people—greed—won't change the world for the better.</p>

    <hr class="hr-long">

    <h2>Preamble.</h2>
    <p>I'm not necessarily against digital currencies. I've bought them, I've earned them, and I've used them. I came for the profit and I stayed for the tech. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't found it fascinating, for a while. Obviously there's technological and academic merit behind cryptography, but far less so for cryptocurrencies despite what the evangelists try to sell you <span class="source">()</span>. Realizing the extent of its shady, ignorant <span class="source">()</span>, and spam-happy proponents who speak in half-truths, false promises, and lies*, I chose to opt out. Since then it has only gotten worse. Their arsenal now includes dimwitted insults such as “have fun staying poor” and laser eyes on their profile pictures. Cool. This whole ordeal has more in common with a pyramid scheme rather than a reasonable investment. Let alone something revolutionary. Truly revolutionary things don't need incessant spam to convey their awesomeness <span class="source">()</span>. I bet the Wright Brothers never uttered “have fun staying grounded” on the <span title="The joke will most certainly be lost on at least one cryptocurrency wiseguy.">Internet</span>. Anyway, with some imagination one could compare this behavior with Leukemia. Bitcoin as a mind cancer, if you will.</p>

    <p class="quote">Leukemia is a blood cancer caused by a rise in the number of white blood cells in your body. Those white blood cells crowd out the red blood cells and platelets that your body needs to be healthy. The extra white blood cells don’t work right <span class="source">()</span>.</p>

    <p>Similarly, the bitcoin evangelists don't work quite right as well—hiding behind the charade of being an immune response against the evil bankers. Yes. Bitcoin was invented to subvert fraudulent contemporary finance <span class="source">()</span>. Which is a respectable cause. But with a modicum of scrutiny one notices that bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) has veered far from its original promise: “A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” <span class="source">()</span>, i.e., money by the people, for the people, against the banks. For one, its predominant use-case isn't cash but financial speculation, gambling. Secondly, it desperately needs the banks for normal people to buy it since obtaining it through mining on regular PCs has become impractical. So much for democratic and decentralized. Subsequently it spawned dozens of new fraudulent banks (exchanges) which have and may still be manipulating the price by buying with exchange-printed fake money <span class="source">()</span>. To top it off, they arbitrarily cheer whenever anyone well-known adopts it, regardless of their background; “Charles Manson is good for bitcoin” wouldn't surprise me at all. Laissez-faire, am I right? For goodness sake, it has become a cesspool of greed that got us into this mess in the first place <span class="source">()</span>. Bitcoin isn't a cure, it's the same disease: money. Money in the hands of fallible humans. </p>

    <p>Have I been salty? Definitely; I could've bought a house had I been in a coma until now. There's no point in denying that. Even worse, I used to experience cognitive dissonance because despite not supporting it, I am aware that it could still grow larger. After all, human greed and stupidity affects the best of us. Case in point: Isaac Newton. He was a mathematical prodigy, but he was also a religious alchemist who invested in the South Sea Bubble <span class="source">()</span>. Moreover, the ultimate irony, <em>Tesla</em> drank the Kool-Aid as well; the company I initially invested in <span class="source">()</span>. Therefore I have no confidence in predicting the course of this mania. Moreover, even if my “investments”† had worked out, I would've merely been lucky by acting on false assumptions and naive convictions. Bitcoin isn't the be-all and end-all, and neither is Elon Musk, but that's another story <span class="source">()</span>.</p>

    <p class="footnote">– – – – – –</p>
    <p class="footnote">* Some do so malevolently, others ignorantly but benevolently.</p>
    <p class="footnote">† Using the word investments in this context is even cringy to write.</p>

    <h2>“The cake is a lie.” Why bitcoin won't solve anything.</h2>
    <h3>Greed.</h3>
    <p>This is the elephant in the room. Bitcoin is still money in the hands of fallible people. Whether it's cash, digital, or Elon Musk's fart particles, no matter the currency, as long as humans can't evolve beyond their greedy nature, nothing will change. All bitcoin has done is make yet another group of rich people, who, as usual, will do anything to preserve and increase their wealth. This I consider hypocritical. These libertarians despise the notion of Universal Basic Income (UBI), yet they have no problem in receiving money by means of a pyramid scheme, i.e., other people buying bitcoin after them. And what does this transfer of wealth add to society, or the less fortunate, or the unbanked? Nothing. Whereas the majority of those in most need of UBI definitely do, since they aren't hedge fudge managers. Relieving humans from having to deal with money would be an actual Copernican revolution. How that would work is beyond me, but that's exactly why it would be revolutionary.</p>

    <h3>Fractional reserve banking.</h3>
    <p>Even if there's a cap of 21 million bitcoin, and if we assume the code won't be altered, it does not stop fractional reserve banking. Just as governments went off the gold standard, they can get off the bitcoin standard. And just as banks lend out money they don't have, they can lend out bitcoin they don't have. Which already happens, a lot. Since most people can't be bothered to get their money of an exchange into their own wallet, they don't actually own their digital coins. As a result, exchanges can do whatever financial shenanigans because they know their customers won't do so.</p>
    <p>This debate of sound money vs. fiat money isn't new. In fact, one of the most reverberating speeches in US history was centered on exactly the same problem: William Jennings Bryan's Cross of Gold speech <span class="source">()</span>.</p>
    <p>Since bitcoin hasn't delivered on its initial promises, it caused a periodical change of narrative. Currently the stock-to-flow theory or the deflationary aspect is its final vestige. “Inflation is theft” is something that instinctively feels right. Let's say you had 10000 in savings, while earning 1000 a month. If due to inflation your savings buy only 9000 worth of stuff, you basically worked a month for free.  That rubs me in the wrong way as well. However, things aren't so cut-and-dry, no matter how much you want it to be (or I wanted it to be). While saving is a virtue, hoarding isn't. And there's a thin line between the two; prudence can turn into greed remarkably quick. Moreover, on a deflationary currency there would hardly be any significant technological progress, lifting millions from poverty.  It doesn't matter if the currency has a limited supply or not because it doesn't stop fractional reserve banking. Which is what instigated the creation of bitcoin in the first place. Hence mentioning the headline “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” in the genesis block.</p>

    <p>“I don't care if we have new banks, as long as I am rich.”</p>

    <h2>Greed.</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>The solutions?</h2>
    <p>Just put financial hucksters in jail.</p>

    <p>stop revering rich people</p>
