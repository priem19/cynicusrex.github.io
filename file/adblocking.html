    <h1>Ad blocking, or how to use the Web properly.</h1>
    <h2>For beginners.</h2>
    <p>
      At the very least use the ad blocker <a href="https://ublockorigin.com">uBlock Origin</a> on a PC. On Android you can use <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jak_linux.dns66/">DNS66</a> to block ads in all your apps by changing your DNS.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>The Web has become infested with tools for advertising. Let's just call it what it is: sheer manipulation—evil <sup>(1)</sup>. By means of your and everyone else's data, accurate predictions are made about human behavior. Armed with such data, agencies are able to make you want things that you don't need by applying the right personally tailored stimuli. Websites have also become increasingly unpleasant to use: ads, cookie consent warnings, CPU intensive scripts, redundant content or visual effects, et cetera. All of this significantly decreases speed and increases bandwidth use. Fortunately you can set up impenetrable defenses; right after the anti-commercial break:</p>
  
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tHEOGrkhDp0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
    <h2>It's not so bad, is it?</h2>
    <p>Take a look at bigthink.com, a seemingly respectable website featuring a video with genuine advice from an astronaut: <a href="https://bigthink.com/videos/be-a-better-leader">https://bigthink.com/videos/be-a-better-leader</a>. Tread carefully though, because it has 14 scripts from blacklisted sites executing code on your device by default.</p>

    <img src="./media/trackerexample.png" alt="uMatrix tracker log">
    
    <p>These scripts' sole purposes are tracking and consumer manipulation. Hence why these domains—shown in dark red—are blacklisted by default as well. They are completely unnecessary for the website to function properly. Moreover, they decrease speed, increase bandwidth usage, and use more power. Take notice that there are non-blacklisted domains that run scripts by default as well; 15 of them. Unless you're adamant on reading comments or seeing superfluous annoying elements on the site, these can also be left disabled. That's 29 good-for-nothing scripts; “Take it all, you fools!” Their audacity is undeniable.</p>
  
    <p>Conversely, shown in dark green are the only domains that must be enabled in order for the video to play. Otherwise the website is usable with every other domain being blocked besides bigthink.com itself.</p>
     
    <h2>So, what to do?</h2>
    <!-- <p>Use <a href="https://www.startpage.com">Startpage</a> as your default search engine. It uses search results from Google, but pays for privacy. The runner up is <a href="duck.com">DuckDuckGo</a> whose search results aren't biased, just as private, but less accurate and complete.</p> -->
  
    <p>The software and extensions below should enable every layman to reduce their intrusive and unpleasant web experiences to zero, provided a willingness to learn and a pinch of experience (e.g. some websites' functionalities can be disabled without you realizing it).</p>
  
    <p>On a PC.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> browser: fast, private, highly customizable. <br>
      <li><a href="https://ublockorigin.com">uBlock Origin</a>: the only relevant ad blocker for browsers.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix">uMatrix</a>: a firewall for your browser. Allow or block any request made by a website, as shown above. I recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TVozpo3zUBk">this tutorial</a>. [I block 1st-party scripts by default to replace <a href="https://noscript.net/">NoScript</a>.]</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/">I don't care about cookies</a>: “Get rid of cookie warnings from almost all websites!”</li>
      <li><a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html">AdGuard DNS</a>: “a foolproof way to block Internet ads that does not require installing any applications.”</li>
      <li>Use Linux. It is superior to Windows in most cases besides gaming; I recommend ArcoLinux (or Xubuntu for beginners). For rare occasions I still dual-boot Windows 7 because 10 is astonishingly insidious.</li>
      <li>Linux only: <a href="https://github.com/hectorm/hblock">hBlock</a>: “[…] gets a list of domains that serve ads, tracking scripts and malware from multiple sources and creates a hosts file, among other formats, that prevents your system from connecting to them.”</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>On Android. <sup>(4)</sup></p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jak_linux.dns66/">DNS66</a>: blocks ads everywhere.</li>
      <li><a href="https://kiwibrowser.com/">Kiwi Browser</a>: fast, no annoyances, supports <em>all</em> extensions such as the three ones above.</li>
      <li><a href="https://newpipe.schabi.org">NewPipe</a>: a privacy minded YouTube frontend. Enables background play, removes all nonsense.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Isn't ad blocking akin to theft?</h2>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p class="quote">“About blocking ads:
      It's important to note that blocking ads is <strong>NOT</strong> theft. Don't fall for this creepy idea, which is the criminalisation of the inalienable right to privacy.
      Ads and trackers violate our privacy, make websites much slower, and deliver dangerous malware. We say no to them.
      We have the right to decide what we download from the Internet, what we send to it, and what we display on our screen.
      We have the right to refuse downloading source code that works against us. It's our bandwidth and computer, and no-one can decide for us what to use them for.
      A service that has valuable features should be able to sell us a subscription, without blackmailing us with ominous ads.”</p>
    
    <p>Quoted from <a href="https://lichess.org/ads">https://lichess.org/ads</a>; from which I got some of the recommendations above. By the way, lichess is completely free, devoid of any ads and trackers, financed by its users. A prime example of how the World Wide Web could be, and should be.</p>
  
    <p>There you have it: a list of proverbial Trojan condoms against literal Trojan horses. Have fun taking agency of your Web experience again.</p>
