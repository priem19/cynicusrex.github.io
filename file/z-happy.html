    <h1>How to be unhappy?</h1>
    <h2>Foreword.</h2>
    This is a short article, for I had time to discard the redundant.

    <p class="quote">“I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter.” —Blaise Pascal (1623 – 1662)</p>

    <p class="quote">“It is better either to be silent, or to say things of more value than silence. Sooner throw a pearl at hazard than an idle or useless word; and do not say a little in many words, but a great deal in a few.” —Pythagoras (570 – 496 BC)</p>
    

    <h2>Prelude.</h2>

    <p>I am not happy. But I have a pretty good idea how one can be. That's because most of our problems have already been experienced, solved, and written about; far better than I or any other contemporary author could.</p>

    <p class="quote">“There is a false saying: “How can someone who can’t save himself save others?” Supposing I have the key to your chains, why should your lock and my lock be the same?” —Friedrich Nietzsche (1844 – 1900)</p>

    <h2>Avoid my mistakes.</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Wisdom.</h2>

    <p class="quote">“The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.” —Isaac Asimov (1920 – 1992)</p>
      
    <p>If people applied the wisdom which philosophers have been painstakingly repeating each generation, I bet we would've been significantly more advanced. Alas, we didn't and still don't. This discouraging thought dawned on me while reading as far back as <em>Marcus Aurelius</em> <sup>(X)</sup> and <em>Diogenes of Sinope</em> <sup>(X)</sup>. Humans are just as stupid now as they were 2000 years ago. We are the cause our own troubles because we perpetually fail to apply the sage's advice. That realization threw me in a nihilistic slump: “Why do anything if people don't change?” Technology and therefore our luxuries have improved, but we did not. We're just as susceptible to religious dogma, greed, gluttony, insobriety, jealousy, vanity, bigotry, hatred, and so on. All the contemporary books written about these topics are mediocre copies of what the ancients said. Everything is borrowed. Sometimes ignorantly, sometimes intentionally.</p>
  
    <p class="quote">“Bernard of Chartres used to say that we [the Moderns] are like dwarves perched on the shoulders of giants [the Ancients], and thus we are able to see more and farther than the latter. And this is not at all because of the acuteness of our sight or the stature of our body, but because we are carried aloft and elevated by the magnitude of the giants.” —Bernard of Chartres (~1115)</p>

    <h2>Read.</h2>
    <p>Because the human condition hasn't changed for centuries it is incredibly rare to create an original book or movie about our trite human foibles. So, we should read instead. If one desperately wants to create, do it in or about science. It is much more likely to contribute something scientifically original because there was no calculus, Internet, or <em>CERN</em> <sup>(X)</sup>, etc. 2000 years ago. Science is built upon shoulders of giants as well, but it's still original. Moreover, the scientific method requires us to deliberately find and acknowledge mistakes, whereas humans are reluctant or too stupid to do so. Even though the technology we take for granted rests upon that ability.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, unless most are copies of each other, and they are. It doesn't mean we shouldn't do anything, but instead, carefully consider what should be done.</p>
  
    <h2>Low expectations.</h2>
    <p class="quote">“The secret to happiness is low expectations.” —Barry Schwartz </p>

    <p>Now that's out of the way, I can proceed by </p>
  
    <h2>Inborn error.</h2>
    <p>When you've come to terms with the former, take heed of the latter: </p>
    <p class="quote">“There is only one inborn error, and that is the notion that we exist in order to be happy. So long as we persist in this inborn error... the world will seem to us full of contradictions. For at every step, in great things and small, we are bound to experience that the world and life are certainly not arranged for the purpose of being happy. That's why the faces of almost all elderly people are deeply etched with such disappointment.” —Arthur Schopenhauer

    </p>
    
    <p>Now apply these insights to this article. It won't be a silver bullet, life will still be a struggle. Fortunately, struggle is what you want:</p>
    <p class="quote">“Let everything that's been planned come true. Let them believe. And let them have a laugh at their passions. Because what they call passion actually is not some emotional energy, but just the friction between their souls and the outside world. And most important, let them believe in themselves. Let them be helpless like children, because weakness is a great thing, and strength is nothing. When a man is just born, he is weak and flexible. When he dies, he is hard and insensitive. When a tree is growing, it's tender and pliant. But when it's dry and hard, it dies. Hardness and strength are death's companions. Pliancy and weakness are expressions of the freshness of being. Because what has hardened will never win.” —Andrei Tarkovsky

    <p class="quote">The richest people are those who need the least.</p>
    <p class="quote">“It was commonplace of Socratic thought that one can be rich by being satisfied with little, and so achieve a measure of invulnerability to fortune. Diogenes radicalized this idea, taking it to the utmost extreme. If one takes into account only one's most basic needs and desires, putting everything else aside as mere fancy and illusion, and is content to satisfy those needs in the simplest and most direct way possible, one needs hardly anything at all; and if one divests oneself of all that one possesses to live as a vagrant, one can anticipate the very worst and become inured to any hardship, and so achieve complete invulnerability to fortune. Dismissing almost everything that people value and pursue, not only luxury and pleasure but also civic and cultural endeavour, as being utterly worthless, one can achieve assured contentment, so Diogenes thought, by living like an animal in the streets, without any concern for the future.”</p>
