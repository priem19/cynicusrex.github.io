    <h1>Why bitcoin could make finance worse.</h1>
    <h2 class="sub-title">Even if we disregard all of bitcoin's shortcomings, a financial instrument that brings out the worst in people—greed—won't change the world for the better.</h2>

    <hr class="hr-long">

    <h2>Preamble.</h2>
    <p>I'm not necessarily against digital currencies. I've bought them, I've earned them, and I've used them before. However, after realizing the extent of its shady, dishonest, immoral, and spam-happy proponents, which makes it have more in common with a pyramid scheme than a reasonable investment, I chose to opt out. Am I salty? Definitely; I could've bought a house if I had been in a coma until now. So there's no point in denying that. Even worse, I'm experiencing cognitive dissonance because I know putting money in it <em>could</em> still be profitable, and because Tesla—the company that I initially invested in—just announced they bought bitcoin as well. “Fate loves irony” has come full circle.</p>

    <h2>Greed.</h2>
    <p>To me this is the elephant in the room. </p>

    <h2>Fractional reserve banking on bitcoin.</h2>

    <h2>The solutions?</h2>
    <p>Just put financial hucksters in jail.</p>

Crypto is in a race - add enough reputable agents of commerce to counter and overcome the inevitable coordinated actions of the ECB/BoJ/Fed/IMF/WorldBank-level powers-that-be to crush it.
