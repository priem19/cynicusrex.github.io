    <h1>Bitcoin is mind cancer.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">Disregarding all of bitcoin's shortcomings, a financial instrument that brings out the worst in people—greed—won't change the world for the better.</p>

    <hr class="hr-long">

    <h2>Preamble.</h2>
    <p>I'm not necessarily against digital currencies (yet). I've bought them, I've earned them, and I've used them. There's obviously technological and academical merit behind cryptography, but far less so for cryptocurrencies despite what the evangelists try to sell you. This is what made me opt out in the end, realizing the extent of its shady, ignorant, and spam-happy proponents <span class="source">()</span>, which makes the whole ordeal have more in common with a pyramid scheme rather than a reasonable investment.</p>

    <p>Have I been salty? Definitely; I could've bought a house had I been in a coma until now. So there's no point in denying that. Even worse, I used to experience cognitive dissonance because despite not supporting it I am aware it could still grow larger since human greed and stupidity affects the best of us. Case in point: beside Isaac Newton being a mathematical prodigy, he was also a religious alchemist who invested in the South Sea Bubble <span class="source">()</span>. Moreover, the ultimate irony, Tesla's Elon Musk drank the Kool-Aid as well; the company I initially invested in <span class="source">(x)</span>. Therefore I have no confidence in predicting the course of this mania. Greed is like mind cancer, or mental leukemia if you will.</p>

    <p class="quote">Leukemia is a blood cancer caused by a rise in the number of white blood cells in your body. Those white blood cells crowd out the red blood cells and platelets that your body needs to be healthy. The extra white blood cells don’t work right <span class="source">()</span>.</p>

    <p>Sounds like bitcoin evangelists doesn't it? Bitcoin being the white blood cells invented as a defence against fraudulent contemporary finance. Which is a worthwhile purpose. However, with a modicum of scrutiny, and one look at the spam-infested Web, you notice that those white blood cells don't work quite right indeed. Bitcoin isn't a cure, it's the same disease: money. In the end, had my “investments”* worked out, I would've merely been lucky by acting on false assumptions. Bitcoin isn't the be-all and end-all, and neither is Elon Musk, but that's another story <span class="source">()</span>.</p>

    <p>* The word investments in this context is even cringy to write.</p>

    <h2>But it's deflationary?</h2>
    <p>It doesn't matter if the currency has a limited supply or not because it doesn't stop fractional reserve banking. Which is what instigated the creation of bitcoin in the first place. Hence mentioning the headline “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” in the genesis block.</p>

    <p>“I don't care if we have new banks, as long as I am rich.”</p>

    <h2>Greed.</h2>
    <p>To me this is the elephant in the room.</p>

    <h2>The solutions?</h2>
    <p>Just put financial hucksters in jail.</p>
