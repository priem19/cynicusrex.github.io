    <p class="sub-title">“What is your profession?” “To be a good person.” —Marcus Aurelius</p>

    <h2>Things I made</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Ideas I support</h2>

    <h3>(Ethical) Veganism</h3>
    <p>I consider eating meat immoral when living in a developed nation—that is until lab grown meat becomes the standard. Even if the meat comes from “humanely bred and killed” sources—which is an oxymoron—it adds to the demand and therefore increases the supply, inevitably increasing factory farming as well. One can live a perfectly healthy life without meat and meat based foodstuff—and from my own experience, even more healthily.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Cynicism</h3>
    <p>“For the Cynics, the purpose of life is to live in virtue, in agreement with nature.” —<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy)">Wikipedia</a></p>

    <p>Naturally flowing from Cynicism is minimalism. The less you need, the less you have to work, the more time you have; for time is the most valuable resource there is.</p>

    </ul>

    <p class="quote">“[…] my choicest possession of all is, as you can observe, that I am always at my leisure, so that I can go off and see what is worth seeing, or hear what is worth hearing, and, what I value first and foremost, I can spend the whole day at leisure with Socrates here. And he likewise does not reserve his admiration for those who can come up with the most money, but spends his time in the company of those whom he finds pleasing.” —Antisthenes (445 – 365 BC); §534, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13112139-diogenes-the-cynic">Diogenes the Cynic: Sayings and Anecdotes, with Other Popular Moralists</a> by <em>Robin Hard</em>.</p>
  
    <h3>Nuclear energy</h3>
    <p>Nuclear energy or atomic energy is green and safe! However, don't take my word for it:</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Revolution in education</h3>
    <p>Currently, the time spent on a topic is fixed, and mastery is variable; the converse should be true. Ultimately, education should nurture curiosity, not stifle it.</p>
    <ul>

      <li><a href="https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">A Mathematician's Lament</a> by <em>Paul Lockhart</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Freethought</h3>
    <p>“[…] beliefs should not be formed on the basis of authority, tradition, revelation, or dogma, and that beliefs should instead be reached by other methods such as logic, reason, and empirical observation.” —<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought">Wikipedia</a></p>

    <h3>Deliberative democracy</h3>
    <p>Only knowledgeable people should be able to vote on policies in their respective fields of expertise. E.g. physicists or engineers voting on whether to fund nuclear energy. People ignorant about a certain topic should have no say in the matter. Unfortunately this is not the case within our <em>representative democracies</em>, in which we let our proverbial hairdressers decide on the intricacies of open heart surgery.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Deliberative democracy, school of thought in political theory that claims that political decisions should be the product of fair and reasonable discussion and debate among citizens.” —<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/deliberative-democracy">Britannica</a>.</li>

    <h3>Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search</h3>
    <p>I fancy esoteric things. The thought of forever having your name tied to a prime number stimulates my curiosity.
